# CDCL SAT Solver

This project implements the CDCL algorithm enhanced with Variable State Independent Decaying Sum (VSIDS) and Non-increasing Variable Elimination Resolution (NiVER). Furthermore, restarts and phase saving as well as clause deletion have been implemented and experimented with.

Note: In particular our Heap implementation as well as some minor details are adapted from MiniSat and modified to serve our use case.

## Build + Run
To build the project, enter `make`. To run the solver on a test file, enter `./main [testfile]`. To build and run immediately, enter `make run arg=[testfile] [heur]`. To run with preprocessing `./main [testfile] [-pre]` or `make run arg=[testfile] [prepr=-pre]`. A similar approach for proof logging:  `./main [testfile] [-proof]` and  `make run arg=[testfile] [proof=-proof]`

**Examples:**

`make run arg=c1` (build and run the .exe on the first competition file )

`./main c1 -pre` (run the compiled .exe on the first competition file with preprocessing)

`./main c2 -proof` (run the compiled .exe on the first competition file with proof logging)
  
`.\run.ps1 -type 't' -start 1 -end 30 ` (run the compiled .exe on the first 30 test files)

`python runCDCL.py c 1 30` (run the compiled .exe on the first 30 comp files)
